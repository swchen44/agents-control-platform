    The session total is the final ``payload.info.total_token_usage``, never a
    sum of the per-step deltas: each ``total_token_usage`` is cumulative and
    monotonic over the session, so the last one already subsumes every prior
    turn. Compaction lowers the live context window but does NOT reset the
    cumulative counter, so "last record" stays correct across a compacted
    session. That monotonicity is ENFORCED, not merely assumed — if
    ``total_tokens`` ever decreases the guard below omits the session's totals.
    Returns ``None`` when the session emitted no ``token_count`` (a
    pre-accounting rollout) or when monotonicity is violated — the totals are
    then OMITTED, not zeroed, and never a guessed-through wrong number.

    WHY SESSION-LEVEL ONLY (evidenced design limit — do not "fix" into
    per-message numbers):
    The argument is STRUCTURAL, not statistical. A ``token_count`` delta
    (``last_token_usage``) measures everything consumed since the *previous*
    ``token_count`` — and one agent-loop step bundles reasoning + assistant
    text + a tool call + its (often large, cached) tool result under a single
    delta. The window contains more than one rendered thing, so a delta cannot
    be attributed to any one message the transcript renders, regardless of
    which record the step happens to end on. The corpus distribution merely
    confirms that steps overwhelmingly end on tool work: measured post-
    inherited-prefix-strip (the records that actually render), n=4138 events
    across 34 sessions, ~75.6% of ``token_count`` events follow a tool-
    execution step and ~22.5% follow an assistant/agent message — but even the
    22.5% are not attributable, because that message shares its delta with the
    reasoning and the next turn's cached context re-read. Per-message (and even
    per-turn) attribution is therefore not recoverable from this stream; the
    session cumulative is the finest honest unit, which is why this returns a

# Lone TOOL surrogates (U+D800–U+DBFF) are not in surrogateescape's
# back-mapping range (which only covers low surrogates U+DC80–U+DCFF
# produced from raw byte decoding), so the surrogateescape-encode step
# in scrub_surrogates would raise on them. Pre-substitute high
# surrogates directly with U+FFFD before the encode step.
_HIGH_SURROGATE_RE = re.compile(r"[\ud800-\udbff]")


def scrub_surrogates(s: Optional[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    """Replace lone surrogates (U+D800…U+DFFF) with U+FFFD.

    Public helper used wherever ``surrogateescape``-decoded JSONL data
    might cross a strict-UTF-8 boundary (issue #139). Examples:
    sqlite3's text-binding path (``cache.update_session_cache``) and
    TUI export (``tui.SessionBrowser._ensure_session_file``) — both
    raise ``UnicodeEncodeError`` on lone surrogates the moment we try
    to persist them.

    Two ranges to handle, with two different mechanisms:

    - **Low surrogates** (U+DC80…U+DCFF) — what ``surrogateescape``
      uses when decoding raw bytes. ``encode("utf-8",
      errors="surrogateescape")`` reverses the mapping back to the
      original raw byte (``\\udcb2`` → ``b"\\xb2"``); the subsequent
      ``decode("utf-8", errors="replace")`` then substitutes those
      invalid bytes with U+FFFD on the decode side.
    - **High surrogates** (U+D800…U+DBFF) — ``surrogateescape`` has
      no mapping for these (they're not produced by raw-byte decoding),
      so the encode step would raise ``UnicodeEncodeError``. Pre-scrub
      them directly via regex substitution before the encode step.

    Why not the simpler ``encode(..., errors="replace")``? That emits
    ASCII ``?`` (U+003F) on encode rather than the canonical Unicode
    replacement U+FFFD on decode — also valid UTF-8, but a less
    informative sentinel.

    Parsing a transcript also reads ``agent-*.meta.json`` sidecars (see

    invalidation: a sidecar appearing after the transcript was cached
    (e.g. a still-running agent spawning a child without touching the
    trunk file) would otherwise go unnoticed by the mtime-only check.

    The fingerprint is ``"<count>:<newest int mtime>"`` over the sidecars
    of the dirs where this transcript's children can live — the sibling
    ``<stem>/subagents/`` dir, plus the containing dir for agent files
    (the flat layout puts children next to their parent). Sidecars are
    written once at spawn time, so count+newest-mtime captures every
    addition and removal. Empty string when there are none.

    Deliberately narrower than ``converter._subagent_meta_map``'s scan
    for TRUNK files: the parse also defensively checks the project dir
    itself, but Claude Code never writes sidecars there, and
    fingerprinting it would rescan a potentially large dir on every

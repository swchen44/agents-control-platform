"""Factory for ``type: "attachment"`` transcript entries (issue #128).

Claude Code records out-of-band events as ``attachment`` JSONL entries:
hook callbacks (``hook_success``, ``hook_blocking_error``, ...),
deferred-tool deltas, queued commands, file references, todo
reminders, and similar harness-side metadata. Until issue #128, all of
these were dropped at parse time as ``PassthroughTranscriptEntry``,
which left the user unable to inspect any hook output even at
full-detail.

This factory promotes the *hook* flavours into a renderable
``HookAttachmentMessage`` and ``queued_command`` (modern steering
deliveries) into a ``UserSteeringMessage``; the remaining non-hook
flavours still return ``None`` so they keep the historical "structural
in DAG, hidden from rendering" behaviour. New attachment flavours can
grow their own factory branch here as needed.

    ``prompt`` is a plain string for a text-only steering delivery, but a
    *list* of content blocks when the steering message carries an image
    (``[{"type": "text", ...}, {"type": "image", ...}]``) — the shape a
    pasted screenshot produces. A string yields the single ``TextContent``
    the pre-list code built by hand, so text-only steering is unaffected.

    Any *other* shape is still rendered, from its ``str()``, rather than
    dropped: silently discarding a steering delivery is indistinguishable
    from there having been none. Such a prompt comes back with
    ``pairable=False`` and the caller is expected to say so out loud —
    see :func:`_create_queued_command_message`.

    ``pairable`` requires **both** a supported shape (``str`` or a list of
    blocks) and non-empty text — text because it is the only thing the
    suppression budget can key on, and shape because a ``str()``-rendered
    fallback is not something we can claim to have matched. Both conditions
    bite independently: an image-only list is renderable but not pairable,
    and a text-bearing ``dict`` is not pairable either. Either way the paired
    ``remove`` simply stays visible.

    Returns ``None`` only when there is nothing at all to render (no
    ``prompt`` key, or an empty/whitespace one) — the one case where
    dropping the card loses nothing.

    Shared by :func:`_create_queued_command_message` and the renderer's
    steering-suppression pre-pass so the two cannot disagree: the
    pre-pass seeds the budget from the ``pairable`` cards only, and every
    card the factory emits that it did *not* count leaves the paired
    legacy ``remove`` visible.

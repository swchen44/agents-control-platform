"""Resolve git commit SHAs to remote-hosted URLs (issue #156).

Used by the mistune SHA-link plugin (``markdown_plugins.py``) to turn
plain ``7c2e6f6``-shaped tokens in rendered Markdown into clickable
links — but only when the commit is actually reachable on a known
remote. Local-only commits stay as plain text so the rendered
transcript doesn't sprout broken links for work-in-progress branches.

## Architecture

- ``resolve_sha(cwd, sha)`` is the all-in-one resolver: from a working
  directory, look up ``origin``'s remote URL, classify the host
  (currently GitHub only), check the SHA is reachable from a
  remote-tracking branch (``git branch -r --contains``), expand short
  SHA → full SHA via ``git rev-parse``, and return the canonical
  commit URL. Returns ``None`` for any failure (no repo, no remote,
  unknown host, unresolved SHA, etc.).

- All ``git`` invocations are wrapped in ``functools.lru_cache`` —
  including the negative cases (``None``/``False`` results) — so a
  large transcript with hundreds of repeated SHAs only pays the
  subprocess cost once per (cwd, sha) tuple.

- A ``contextvars.ContextVar`` carries the per-render canonical cwd so
  the cached singleton mistune renderers don't have to be rebuilt per
  transcript. Use the ``render_with_repo_context(cwd)`` context
  manager at the top of a render pass; the SHA plugin's resolver
  reads the var transparently.

## Why not ``git ls-remote``?

``ls-remote`` hits the network on every call (~hundreds of ms even
warm). We rely on the user's local remote-tracking refs being
reasonably fresh — the typical claude-code-log invocation follows a
``git fetch`` for the same repo that produced the transcript. If a
SHA on the remote isn't yet reflected locally, it renders as plain
text; that's a correct-but-slightly-conservative fallback.

## Adding new hosts

``_HOST_URL_PATTERNS`` is the dispatch table. The URL parser in
``_parse_git_url`` handles SSH and HTTPS shapes uniformly, so adding
a new public forge is a one-line entry. For self-hosted instances
(in-house GitLab, Gitea, etc.) we can't enumerate every host name
the world might use, so there's also a fallback-template mechanism
read from the ``CLAUDE_CODE_LOG_GIT_LINK`` environment variable
(set directly, or via the ``--git-link`` CLI flag). The fallback
template uses ``{host}``, ``{path}``, and ``{sha}`` placeholders
and is consulted only when the static map misses, so a user with a
mix of public-forge and self-hosted repos still gets correct links
from both.
